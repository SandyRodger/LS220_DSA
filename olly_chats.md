To talk about:

- what are logorithms and how to think about them.
- 3 possible paths:
 1. rush to capstone
    - Advantages:
      - Great job,
      - better prospects
      - The advantages list is short, but these points will have exponential effects on my whole life.
    - Disadvantages:
      - rush material
      - if i get such a job it will be throwing me in the deep-end
      - There's a chance I won't be accepted to Capstone:
        -  (criminal record,
        -  UK based,
        -  taken too long,
        -  grades not exemplary)
      -  Living out of kilter with normal diurnal rhythms would be doable, but costly.
      -  I would have to lean more on my parents for financial support
      -  The disadvantages list is long, but they are all short term and would be worth it if I make it to the end of Capstone.
  2. apply immediately for jobs
    - advantages:
      - I need a job + money
    - disadvantages:
      - Undermines the point of launch school to take ones time and start one's career as one means to go on
  3. push for the end and then apply for jobs.
      - advantages:
        - a middle path between two extremes
        - If I want to improve my prospects there are other ways than capstone.
        - I feel like I want to spend more time with the material.
      - Disadvantages:
        - Miss capstone
        - Still probably need to lean on parents for more financial support.
4. Compromise now, but continue to aim for capstone-like results with other resources like csprimer.

- How much of this DSA stuff do you think about on a daily basis?
- How much of it was applicable to your first coding job

- Can I use my calorie counter as a portfolio project.
- What can I build online that an emploter would look at as evidence that I'm a coding mensch (ie, codewars consistency)
- Reasons I'm hesitant to apply for coding jobs:
 - no portfolio.
 - shaky memory of previous modules.

Application letter for Immersive Labs Backend engineer:

Dear Immersive labs:

I'm interested in the role of Backend Engineer (https://cord.co/u/immersive-labs/jobs/166475-backend-engineer). I think I would be a good fit for this role in your company. Let me tell you a little about myself.

My name is Sandy Rodger (35, m). I have until now worked as a language teacher abroad and in Brighton UK. Havibng picked up 3 foreign languages a software engineer friend recommended coding as a more rewarding career-path. So for the last few years I have been retraining online as a software engineer at launchschool.com. The pedagogy at Launch School prioritises a "slow-path to mastery" in contrast to many of the codingh boot camps available that guarantee a job in x months/week if one commits to their course. 

At Launch school I have learnt:

 - ...

You can see some of my projects at my github page:

 - calorie counter
 - sonicPi Arvo Part

I am eager to be part of an engineering team where I will be able to use my skills and learn from the expertise of my colleagues. I love coding and I love working with people so I think I would be a good fit at Immersive Labs.
