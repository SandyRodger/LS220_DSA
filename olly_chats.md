To talk about:

- what are logorithms and how to think about them.
- 3 possible paths:
  - rush to capstone
    - Advantages:
      - Great job,
      - better prospects
      - The advantages list is short, but these points will ripple out and have exponential effects on my whole life.
    - Disadvantages:
      - rush material
      - if i get such a job it will be throwing me in the deep-end
      - There's a chance I won't be accepted to Capstone:
        -  (criminal record,
        -  UK based,
        -  taken too long,
        -  grades not exemplary)
      -  Living out of kilter with normal diurnal rhythms would be doable, but costly.
      -  I would have to lean more on my parents for financial support
      -  The disadvantages list is long, but they are all short term and would be worth it if I make it to the end of Capstone.
  - apply immediately for jobs
    - advantages:
      - I need a job + money
    - disadvantages:
      - Undermines the point of launch school to take ones time and start one's career as one means to go on
  - push for the end and then apply for jobs.
      - advantages:
        - a middle path between two extremes
        - If I want to improve my prospects there are other ways than capstone.
      - Disadvantages:
        - Miss capstone
        - Still probably need to lean on parents for more financial support.
