Construct Tree from given Inorder and Preorder traversals

Given in-order and pre-order traversals of a Binary Tree, the task is to construct the Binary Tree and return its root.

Use O(n) time complexity

Example:

Input: inorder[] = [3, 1, 4, 0, 5, 2], preorder[] = [0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5]
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Explanation: The tree will look like:
