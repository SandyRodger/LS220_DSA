Hi everyone! Next week, I’ll be staying on a hospital ward for 5 days (as part of a clinical trial—don’t worry, I’m not sick). Since I won’t be able to leave, go outside, or do any strenuous exercise, I’m trying to figure out how to make the most of my time.
I want to stay productive and keep a structured routine while I’m there. My plans include studying, doing some watercolours, and fitting in some yoga.
Has anyone had to deal with a similar situation—whether it’s staying in a hospital, dormitory, or another setting with limited movement? I’d love to hear your tips on:
Creating and sticking to a daily schedule in a confined environment
Avoiding cabin fever
Staying focused without overworking yourself
Any advice would be super helpful! Thanks!
